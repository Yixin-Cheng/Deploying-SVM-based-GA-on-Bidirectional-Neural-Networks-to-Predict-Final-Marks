# Specification of BDNN and GA on Mark Prediction

## 1. Pre-processing
**preprocessor.py** is used for pre-processing raw data (data.csv),in this file, there are several functions for organising, imputing and transforming.
This file produces a new data set(preprocessing.csv, which is composed of 153 student's records with 16 columns)
## 2. Apply basic NN on data set
**nndataloader.py** is used for applying, which processes the data set produced by preprocessing file

## 3. Post-processing
**postprocessor.py** is used for post-processing preprocessing.csv which categories the classes and their sub-classes

## 4. Apply BDNN on post-processed data set

**bdnndataloader.py** applies BDNN on training data set(train_data.csv) and testing on test
data set (test_data.csv)

## 5. train_data.csv and test_data.csv
There two data sets are composed of 4 classes of final results(1,2,3,4 represents mean of Fail, Pass, Credit and Distinct respectively and their 18 sub-classes(3 in F and D, 6 in P and C) which are generated by 4 classes procceeding)

Each of data set contains 22 patterns (representatives) and 15 columns(final column is final and previous ones are grades in different tests or assignments and other students' information) to construct one-to-one relationship.
## 6. ga_data.csv
This data set is produced by genetic algorithm for selecting partial feature of preprocessed dataset
## 7. GA+BDNN
**ga_bdnn_dataloader** applies BDNN and GA on ga_data.csv
## 8. GA+NN
**ga_nn_dataloader** implements NN and GA on ga_data.csv
## 9. Libraries
1. torch
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. sklearn
5. re
